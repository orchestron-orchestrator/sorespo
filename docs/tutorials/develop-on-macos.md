# Developing SORESPO on macOS

## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through making your first changes to the
SORESPO automation code and building the application. If you are not yet
familiar with the basic steps involved in running and interacting with
SORESPO, you might want to start out with the tutorial on
[running SORESPO](run-on-macos.md) first.

## Preparing the Environment

* Install the following prerequisites:
  * [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
  * [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac) and *coreutils* , both of which
    you can install with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
  ```shell
  brew install git coreutils
  ```
  * [Acton](https://acton.guide/install_tip.html) (*Note:* This is an additional prerequite compared to [running SORESPO](run-on-macos.md))
* After the installation has completed, start *Docker Desktop* and open the
  *Settings*. In the *Resources* section, make sure you've allocate at least 4
  CPU cores and 8GB of RAM to Docker.

## Starting the SORESPO Network
*NOTE*: If you already completed the tutorial on [running SORESPO](run-on-macos.md),
you can skip ahead to the [next step](develop-on-macos.md#modifying-the-sorespo-application)!

First, if you haven't already, clone the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/orchestron-orchestrator/sorespo.git
```

Then, go into the `sorespo/test/quicklab-srl` directory and start the development
tutorial:
```shell
cd sorespo/test/quicklab-srl
make dev-tutorial
...
... # Containerlab starts the SR Linux lab, this may take a few minutes ...
...
Orchestron/sorespo running..
...
All config files applied
...
```

You now have a running lab topology with fully configured containerized
routers. The current state of the lab is identical to the final step in the
[tutorial on running SORESPO](run-on-macos.md).

----

*Notes*:
* The SORESPO process runs interactively in this shell window. When you kill
  it with *Ctrl+C*, SORESPO itself will stop, but the lab and all the
  routers will continue to run.
* You will need to **open a second shell** to enter further commands and
  continue with the tutorial.
* The lab can be shut down with `make stop`.

## Modifying the SORESPO application

Changing the application typically involves modifying the RFS transforms to
modify the output configuration and optionally modifying the models.

Let's first retrieve the current configuration on the `ams-core-1` router, we
will do so by connecting to the router directly over NETCONF.
In a new shell navigate to the `sorespo/test/quicklab-srl`
directory and get the configuration:
```shell
cd sorespo/test/quicklab-srl
make get-dev-config-ams-core-1 | sed -n '/<interface xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces">/,/<\/interface>/p'
```
*NOTE*: The `sed` command filters the output down to the section we are
interested in for the purpose of this tutorial.

Part of the output is the VRF interface:
```xml
...
<interface xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces">
    <name>ethernet-1/3</name>
    <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
    <vlan-tagging xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces-vlans">true</vlan-tagging>
    <subinterface>
        <index>100</index>
        <description>Customer VPN access SITE-1 [SNA-1-1] in VPN acme-65501</description>
        <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
        <ipv4>
            <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
            <address>
                <ip-prefix>10.201.1.1/30</ip-prefix>
            </address>
        </ipv4>
        <vlan xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces-vlans">
            <encap>
                <single-tagged>
                    <vlan-id>100</vlan-id>
                </single-tagged>
            </encap>
        </vlan>
    </subinterface>
</interface>
...
```

Notice how SORESPO filled in a handy interface description for the
subinterface, but there is no description on the main `ethernet-1/3`
interface. We will now modify the SORESPO code to add one in.

Open `sorespo/src/sorespo/rfs.act` in your favorite editor and find the
following section of the code:

```python
class VrfInterface(base.VrfInterface):
    def transform(self, i, di):
        ...
        elif "srl_nokia-system" in di.modules:
            print("RFS /rfs{{{di.name}}}/vrf-interface transform running {i.name} for Nokia SRLinux", err=True)
            dev = srl25.root()

            # Create the main interface
            intf = dev.interface.create(main_intf)
            intf.admin_state = "enable"
            intf.vlan_tagging = True
```

Now, modify `sorespo/src/sorespo/rfs.act` to set an interface description on
VRF interfaces:
```diff
class VrfInterface(base.VrfInterface):
    def transform(self, i, di):
        ...
        elif "srl_nokia-system" in di.modules:
            print("RFS /rfs{{{di.name}}}/vrf-interface transform running {i.name} for Nokia SRLinux", err=True)
            dev = srl25.root()

            # Create the main interface
            intf = dev.interface.create(main_intf)
            intf.admin_state = "enable"
            intf.vlan_tagging = True
+           intf.description = "VRF Interface for customer connections"
```

After you have saved the file to disk, you can re-build the SORESPO binary
to incorporate the change. Press *Ctrl+C* in the terminal window where
SORESPO is running.

Then in the same terminal window trigger a build.
* If you are running macOS on Apple Silicon use:
```shell
make -C ../../ build-aarch64
```
* If you are running macOS on Intel use:
```shell
make -C ../../ build-linux
```
*NOTE*: With `-C ../../` we instruct `make` to run the `build-<arch>` recipe
two levels up from the current directory, saving us the hassle of moving around in
the directory structure.

After the build has completed you can copy your updated binary into the lab and
re-run and re-configure SORESPO:
```shell
make copy run-and-configure
```

Wait a few seconds for SORESPO to apply your changes to the routers and
repeat the steps above to validate your change was successful.
```shell
make get-dev-config-ams-core-1 | sed -n '/<interface xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces">/,/<\/interface>/p'
```

We can now see the interface description has been applied to each of the VRF
interfaces on our routers:
```diff
...
<interface xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces">
    <name>ethernet-1/3</name>
+   <description>VRF Interface for customer connections</description>
    <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
    <vlan-tagging xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces-vlans">true</vlan-tagging>
    <subinterface>
        <index>100</index>
        <description>Customer VPN access SITE-1 [SNA-1-1] in VPN acme-65501</description>
        <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
        <ipv4>
            <admin-state>enable</admin-state>
            <address>
                <ip-prefix>10.201.1.1/30</ip-prefix>
            </address>
        </ipv4>
        <vlan xmlns="urn:nokia.com:srlinux:chassis:interfaces-vlans">
            <encap>
                <single-tagged>
                    <vlan-id>100</vlan-id>
                </single-tagged>
            </encap>
        </vlan>
    </subinterface>
</interface>
...
```

### Modifying the SORESPO YANG models

Besides modifying transform code, you may also want to modify the YANG models
themselves to be able to pass different parameters from layer to layer.

Retrieve the current input to the RFS layer, i.e. `layer2`:
```shell
make get-config2 | sed -n '/<vrf-interface>/,/<\/vrf-interface>/p'
```

Part of the output will be a configuration instance for the `vrf-interface` on `ams-core-1`:
```xml
...
  <vrf-interface>
    <name>ethernet-1/3.100</name>
    <description>Customer VPN access SITE-1 [SNA-1-1] in VPN acme-65501</description>
    <vrf>acme-65501</vrf>
    <ipv4-address>10.201.1.1</ipv4-address>
    <ipv4-prefix-length>30</ipv4-prefix-length>
  </vrf-interface>
</rfs>
...
```

This RFS instance at present does not have an input for MTU configuration. We
can also see this by reviewing the YANG model for this layer in
`sorespo/gen/yang/rfs/sorespo-rfs.yang`.

```yang
...
list vrf-interface {
    key "name";
    orchestron:rfs-transform sorespo.rfs.VrfInterface;
    leaf name {
        type string;
    }
    leaf description {
        type string;
    }
    leaf vrf {
        type string;
        description
            "VRF name";
        mandatory true;
    }
    leaf ipv4-address {
        type inet:ipv4-address;
    }
    leaf ipv4-prefix-length {
        type uint8 {
            range "1..31";
        }
        default "30";
    }
}
```

Modify the YANG module to add in the `mtu` leaf:
```diff
...
list vrf-interface {
    key "name";
    orchestron:rfs-transform sorespo.rfs.VrfInterface;
    leaf name {
        type string;
    }
    leaf description {
        type string;
    }
    leaf vrf {
        type string;
        description
            "VRF name";
        mandatory true;
    }
    leaf ipv4-address {
        type inet:ipv4-address;
    }
    leaf ipv4-prefix-length {
        type uint8 {
            range "1..31";
        }
        default "30";
    }
+   leaf mtu {
+       type uint16 {
+           range "..9000";
+       }
+   }
}
```

Open `sorespo/src/sorespo/inter.act` in your favorite editor and find the
following section of the code:

```python
...
class L3Vpn(base.L3Vpn):
    def transform(self, i):
...
            vi = rfs.vrf_interface.create(ep.interface)
            vi.description = "Customer VPN access %s [%s] in VPN %s" % (ep.site, ep.site_network_access, i.name)
            vi.ipv4_address = ep.provider_ipv4_address
            vi.ipv4_prefix_length = ep.ipv4_prefix_length
            vi.vrf = i.name
```

Now, modify `sorespo/src/sorespo/inter.act` to set an MTU on VRF interfaces:
```diff
...
class L3Vpn(base.L3Vpn):
    def transform(self, i):
...
            vi = rfs.vrf_interface.create(ep.interface)
            vi.description = "Customer VPN access %s [%s] in VPN %s" % (ep.site, ep.site_network_access, i.name)
            vi.ipv4_address = ep.provider_ipv4_address
            vi.ipv4_prefix_length = ep.ipv4_prefix_length
            vi.vrf = i.name
+           vi.mtu = 1500
```


After you have saved the files to disk, you can re-build the SORESPO binary
to incorporate the change. Once again, press *Ctrl+C* in the terminal window
where SORESPO is running.

Then, in the same terminal window, request the Orchestron build system and
Acton YANG parser to re-generate the codebase from the SORESPO YANG modules:
```shell
make -C ../../ gen
```

Then in the same terminal window trigger a build.
* If you are running macOS on Apple Silicon use:
```shell
make -C ../../ build-aarch64
```
* If you are running macOS on Intel use:
```shell
make -C ../../ build-linux
```

After the build has completed you can copy your updated binary into the lab and
re-run and re-configure SORESPO:
```shell
make copy run-and-configure
```

Wait a few seconds for SORESPO to start and retrieve the configuration for
`layer2`.
```shell
make get-config2
```

Part of the output will be a configuration instance for the `vrf-interface` on
`ams-core-1`:
```diff
...
  <vrf-interface>
    <name>ethernet-1/3.100</name>
    <description>Customer VPN access SITE-1 [SNA-1-1] in VPN acme-65501</description>
    <vrf>acme-65501</vrf>
    <ipv4-address>10.201.1.1</ipv4-address>
    <ipv4-prefix-length>30</ipv4-prefix-length>
+   <mtu>1500</mtu>
  </vrf-interface>
...
```

*Note*: In reality, You wouldn't likely hard-code the MTU in the Intermediate
Transform. We would expect the MTU to be passed down from higher layers, e.g.
from the CFS intent all the way down to the device configuration. But the
development process from here on out is always the same.

## What's Next
Now that you are familiar with running and developing for SORESPO, continue
to explore the [other labs](../../test/README.md) we have available, including
more router vendors etc..
