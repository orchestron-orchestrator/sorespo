     "The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
      name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

      Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
      3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
      2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
      for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
      future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
      domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
      (host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
      that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
      in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
      1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
      schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
      adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

      The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
      to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
      prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
      byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
      notation.

      The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
      type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
      IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
      may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
      and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
      which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
      explicitly or may depend on the configuration of the
      resolver.

      6.2.1, 6.2.2.1, and 6.2.2.2.  All unnecessary
      percent-encoding is removed, and all case-insensitive
      characters are set to lowercase except for hexadecimal
      digits, which are normalized to uppercase as described in
      Section 6.2.2.1.

      The purpose of this normalization is to help provide
      unique URIs.  Note that this normalization is not
      sufficient to provide uniqueness.  Two URIs that are
      textually distinct after this normalization may still be
      equivalent.

      Objects using the uri type may restrict the schemes that
      they permit.  For example, 'data:' and 'urn:' schemes
      might not be appropriate.

      A zero-length URI is not a valid URI.  This can be used to
      express 'URI absent' where required.
